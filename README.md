# A Tour of Core Lightning

Core Lightning (CLN) is a lightweight, highly customizable and standard compliant implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network protocol. We're going to spin up a couple nodes, make a regtest lightning network, and sling some sats around making payments between the nodes. 

We'll be running everything in this repl, all the dependencies are set up through Replit's Nix backend, but if you're interested in how to install and run Core Lightning on your machine see the walkthrough under "Installation" in [the coreln github repo](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning). If you want to run it with Nix like we do here, see [nix-bitcoin](https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin), a collection of Nix packages and NixOS modules for easily installing full-featured Bitcoin (and Lightning) nodes.

We're going to learn how to:

    1. Set up a CLN regtesting environment to play around in. We'll make 3 lightning nodes with a shared bitcoind backend (more on this later).
    2. Explore the plugin architecture and plug a couple more processes in for additional functionality.
    3. Connect your CLN nodes, fund them in a regtesting environment, and open one way channels.
    4. Create and pay bolt11 invoices from the command line.
    5. Perform a collaborative channel open with liquidity ads to dual-fund a balanced channel.

If you'd like to start contributing to CoreLN, please [hop into the discord](https://discord.gg/gPnhAvkaGq), open an issue or advance a PR [in the github repo](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), or follow the project [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/core_LN). 

You can find Base58 [on our website](https://www.base58.info/) and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/base58btc), where we'll be posting about our upcoming bitcoin protocol development classes and other repls like this one walking through open source bitcoin projects.

We've cloned a copy of the core lightning repo into this repl in the "lightning" folder if you want to poke around in it! (the HACKING.md file we've copied to the top level of this filetree gives a walkthrough of the codebase and advice on how to start contributing). That's not the code we'll be using for the exercises, we're using the nixpkgs we loaded into the repl so you can run it all on the repl's shell, so don't be scared to tweak around in there while we teach you about CoreLN :)

Let's get started!

## Setting Up Your CoreLN Regtesting Environment

We've set up the dependencies already for you to run bitcoin and lightning on regtest in this repl. Run the following command in the shell to start your bitcoin daemon on regtest (this will build a .bitcoin folder, we need this for the regtest script we're about to run). 
```
bitcoind -regtest -daemon -fallbackfee=0.000025

## You should see:
## Bitcoin Core starting

```

We've now got the bitcoin core daemon running on regnet as a background process in our repl! We can interact with it by issue commands through the bitcoin command line interface (we have to tell the cli to talk to regtest though! that's why we add the -regtest flag)

```
bitcoin-cli -regtest help

## this shows you all the commands you can run using the cli. if you want info about
## a specific command you can try the command followed by help e.g.

bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress help
```


Niftynei wrote a startup_regtest.sh script (it's also available in the lightning/contrib folder if you're following along on your local machine) that runs through all the aliasing and setup for regtesting with CLN that we won't get into here (it's nicely documented though so feel free to read through it) We've copied here in the repl and running it will start up a bitcoin daemon process on regtest with 3 CLN nodes sharing it as a backend. 

Side Note: Lightning nodes don't always need to run their own bitcoin backends, they just need a way to get on-chain data like what the UTXO set is currently and a way to broadcast transactions. There's actually a plugin for CoreLN called "sauron" which lets you start a node that uses blockstream.info's Esplora API to get and send on-chain data. It makes running a lightning node easier but makes you entirely reliant on trusting blockstream!

You can start up the bitcoin and lightning regtesting environment by running the following command in your repl's shell. The script sets a bunch of aliases for your bitcoin and lightning nodes to make typing commands easier:

```
source ./startup_regtest.sh
```

Then spin up your bitcoin backend and 3 lightning nodes by running:
```
start_ln 3
```

If you see the following, you've just spun up your core lightning nodes and your regtest environment is ready to play! now instead of having to type long command line arguments, we can use the following aliases to interact with our lightning and bitcoin nodes through the command line.
```
[1] 192 ## this is the process id of cln node1, aliased to l1
[2] 221 ## this is the process id of cln node2, aliased to l2
[3] 255 ## this is the process id of cln node3, aliased to l3
Commands: 
    l1-cli, l1-log,
    l2-cli, l2-log,
    l3-cli, l3-log,
    bt-cli, stop_ln
```

### Exercise A 
Copy down the connection info for your 3 coreln nodes. You can find them by running `getinfo` for each node like `l1-cli getinfo`, and combining the id, address, and port info as such

```
## id@address:port
## e.g. 038ae5cab4c52ba987dba51536632ae12d90c10138e8e0a0163eae042d03458593@127.0.0.1:7171

## l1 Connection info:

## l2 Connection info:

## l3 Connection info:
```

## So What Exactly IS a Core Lightning Node?

Let's briefly talk about what we mean when we say we 'started our core lightning nodes'. Your Core Lightning "Node" is a node in the lightning network, it is the set of processes which "speak" the lightning protocol. We can add additional processes and functionality to that lightning "node", or remove them sometimes, and this is what brings us to the core lightning architecture of *plugins*.

### Core Lightning Plugins

When you started your core lightning nodes, your terminal printed out the process ids of each of your 3 nodes (they'll be different for you, for me they were 192, 221, 255, see above). Let's look at the process tree, the parent process and child subprocesses, for our first lightning node, by running the following command:
```
pstree 221 ## replace this with your l1's processid
```

Which should output something like...
```
-+= 00221 runner /nix/store/8kgsjv57icc18qhpmj588g9x1w34hi4j-bash-interactive-5.1-p12/bin/bash -rcfile /nix/store/dzpjafx42kx0rmkqyba0m46vpkbjk62r-replit-bashrc/bashrc 
 \-+- 00223 runner lightningd --lightning-dir=/tmp/l2-regtest

   \--- 00230 runner /nix/store/...clightning-0.10.2/bin/../libexec/c-lightning/plugins/autoclean
```
(nix dependencies make these kinda hard to read, I've replaced the hash check, pfxk1qxj7p82ziljikwgsxm7h68c0yq2, with '...'. If you can't read them try increasing the shell window size, running it so it prints out nicely, then resizing it back down)

So what's going on here? 

We've got a parent lightningd, aka lightning daemon, process, and almost a dozen child processes, which "plug in" to the parent process and together make up the lightning "node". This is a unique architecture to core lightning, and allows for extreme flexibility and modularity by plugging in and unplugging different processes depending on what we want or need.

Core Lightning ships with a bunch of default plugins, those listed above when you ran pstree, but if we want additional functionality we can plug that functionality into the running lightnigd process.

## Plugging in Our Own Plugins
We've cloned down a bunch of coreln plugins from github to the "plugins" folder in your file tree, feel free to take a look at some of the different plugins. CoreLN itself is written in C, but the modular plugins architecture allows you to write your own plugins in whatever languages you want like Rust, Python, or Go.

We're going to use some of the python ones like "helpme" and "summary" to help us set up and manage our regtest lightning nodes.

First, we'll install some dependencies for doing lightning network things in python,
```
pip install pyln-client pyln-proto pyln-bolt1 pyln-bolt4 pyln-bolt7
```

Then start the "helpme" plugin for our first node l1, a fun plugin that helps you set up and use your core lightning node! Notice that we don't have to spin down the nodes, we're plugging in these additional processes with 0 down time.

```
l1-cli plugin start $PWD/plugins/helpme/helpme.py
```

When you start a new plugin, coreln will show you all of the currently running processes including the newly started one. You should see an output that ends with:
```
      ...
         "name": "/nix/store/pfxk1qxj7p82ziljikwgsxm7h68c0yq2-clightning-0.10.2/bin/../libexec/c-lightning/plugins/spenderp",
         "active": true
      },
      {
         "name": "/home/runner/Base58-A-Tour-Of-Core-Lightning/plugins/helpme/helpme.py",
         "active": true
      }
   ]
```
Notice that all of the default plugins are listed, along with our new "helpme" plugin which is now running.

### Exercise B
```
Start the helpme plugin for the other 2 lightning nodes, l2 and l3. You just have to slightly modify the command we used above.
```

## 'Helpme' Run my CoreLN Node
We're going to run through the helpme instructions for 1 node, l1, then you can run through the same processes for l2 and l3 for additional practice at the end!

Now that we've got helpme plugged in, let's see if it can help us set up and run our lightning node. Run,
```
l1-cli helpme
```

Which should output:
```
Welcome to Core-Lightning!

The lightning network consists of bitcoin channels between computers
(like this one), and the ability to send those bitcoins between them.

It's still beta sofware, so DON'T PUT TOO MUCH MONEY in your lightning
node!  Be prepared to lose your funds (but please report a bug if you do!)

*** You are on TESTNET, not real bitcoin!  See 'helpme mainnet'
STAGE 1 (funds): INCOMPLETE: No bitcoins yet.  Try 'helpme funds'
STAGE 2 (peers): Not connected to the network.  Try 'helpme peers'
STAGE 3 (channels): INCOMPLETE: No channels open.  Try 'helpme channels'
STAGE 4 (making payments): INCOMPLETE: No payments made.  Try 'helpme pay'
STAGE 5 (receiving payments): INCOMPLETE: No payments made.  Try 'helpme invoice'
STAGE 6 (adding bling): You have not customized alias or color.  Try 'helpme bling'
```

So let's walk through it!

## Stage 1: Funding our Lightning Nodes
The first thing we'll need is some bitcoin. Now this is regtest, so we'll have to do things a little differently than on chain. We're in complete control of the regtest environment, so we can mine blocks and generate coins as we like. For simplicity, let's mine coins to the layer 1 bitcoin node, bt-cli, and send from there to our lightning nodes as necessary.

In regtest we use the command `generatetoaddress` to generate a block where the block reward goes to an address we control. Run the following to mine 101 blocks where the coinbase reward goes to the bt-cli's wallet. (we do 101 blocks because coinbase outputs are only spendable after 100 confirmations).
```
bt-cli generatetoaddress 101 $(bt-cli getnewaddress)
```

You should see an array of hashes if this worked, those are the block ids for the blocks you just mined. Check that you've got a 50BTC coin in the wallet by running,
```
bt-cli listunspent ## you'll actually have 2 coins here, the regtest startup script starts at block 1 instead of block 0, but usually when you're running regtests yourself you'll follow this process as we did it here mining 101 blocks
```

So now we've got a bunch of bitcoin on our bt-cli layer 1 node. We have to send that bitcoin to addresses controlled by our lightning nodes. First we generate an address for each of our nodes:

```
l1-cli newaddr && l2-cli newaddr && l3-cli newaddr
```

Then we send some bitcoin to each one of these nodes, let's do 10 BTC to each one. We can do this in a single tx using the bitcoin-cli sendmany command,

```
bt-cli sendmany '' '{"replace_me_with_l1_address": 10, "replace_me_with_l2_address": 10, "replace_me_with_l3_address": 10}'

## for example this could look like
## bt-cli sendmany '' '{"bcrt1qeg4k75dj5gq5hrtg39j4v09ycp6hs0rcc0l3ws": 10, "bcrt1q0zej0qnvqyc55re4hu4rdrhc5q249cxqd3glaf": 10, "bcrt1qekt723mjayza474qlcrgcc28q9uw683ut0v8f7": 10}'
```
(make sure you have the empty string, '', between sendmany and your json of address:amount, it's a formatting thing)

If the transaction went through, bitcoind returns the txid of the transaction confirming it was sent to the mempool. If you run `l1-cli listfunds` right now though, you won't see anything. There's 2 reasons why:
    1. We're on regtest where WE control the block production, so we need to mine a block to confirm the TX in the first place.
    2. CLN won't let you open channels with UTXOs that aren't at least a block deep. Best practice is to wait 6 blocks so let's mine those right now:

```
bt-cli generatetoaddress 6 $(bt-cli getnewaddress)
```

Now if we run l1-cli helpme again, we'll see...

```
STAGE 1 (funds): COMPLETE (1000000000000msat a.k.a. 10.00000000btc)
```

## Stage 2: Connecting to Peers

Our lightning nodes have been running for a little while, let's see if our nodes can see each other...
```
$ l1-cli getinfo
{
   "id": "03e46bab701efb2503f1c48d56654674e0e3836f6dd92a851887b3de8c3800c7fb",
   "alias": "WEIRDROUTE",
   "color": "03e46b",
   "num_peers": 0,
   ...
}
```

Alright, what's going on? Why do we not have any peers, even though we have 3 nodes running on our regtest network? Well the first thing we can do is follow helpme's recommendation and run:
```
l1-cli helpme peers
```

Our nodes start as islands, they're not connected and don't automatically connect to each other by default. Now if this were mainnet or testnet our software would come seede with a bunch of random nodes to start trying to connect to, but on regtest the Lightning Nodes actually don't have any idea how to connect to each other. We have to do it manually. Let's connect l1 to l2 using the connection info you wrote down earlier.
```
## replace connection info with your l2 node's connection infow you should have it above or just run l2-cli getinfo
l1-cli connect node_id@ip_address:port

## e.g. $ l1-cli connect 022979576a85cbc73cc3d8a8928a3a9c7c97995983822ca8854ab5c69f327f3073@127.0.0.1:7272

```

You should see a return json like this:
```
{
   "id": "022979576a85cbc73cc3d8a8928a3a9c7c97995983822ca8854ab5c69f327f3073", ## l2's node_id
   "features": "08026aa2",
   "direction": "out",
   "address": {
      "type": "ipv4",
      "address": "127.0.0.1", ## l2's address
      "port": 7272 ## l2's port
   }
}
```

Now if we run l1-cli getinfo, we should see that we've got a peer!

### Exercise C
    1. Connect l2 to l3 using the same process as above. 
    2. Try running l2-cli listpeers, then repeat the listpeers command for l1 and l3. You should see l2 has 2 peers after connecting the 2 of them, but l1 and l3 only have 1. 
    

## Stage 3: Opening Channels

Alright, now that our nodes have peer connections (l1 with l2, l2 with l3) we're ready to open our first channel! 

Through the peer connection, our nodes can pass INFORMATION back and forth. Notice that if you run getinfo on l1 and l3, both only have 1 peer, l2. They don't know about each other yet, only about their connection to l2, they haven't gossipped their peers' info to each other yet. We'll get back to that when we talk about the difference between PEERS and NODES.

Through a channel, our nodes can pass VALUE. A channel opens as an on-chain, layer 1 bitcoin transaction. We can open 1 way channels pretty easily: let's open a 1-way channel from l1 to l2. On-chain, this will look like we're locking bitcoin to a custom script. We won't reveal that the lock was a 2-2 multisig, which people generally assume nowadays to be a lightning channel when they see it on chain, unless we close the channel.

Each node should now have a 10BTC UTXO. We can confirm this by running listfunds.
```
l1-cli listfunds
```

We're now going to open a 10million sat channel between l1 and l2, where l1 is the only party funding the channel so starts with owning all the bitcoin in it. To open the channel we need to specify:
    1. Which node id we're opening to.
    2. How much of our funds we'd like to commit to the channel.
    3. and what feerate we'd like to pay to the miners

Remembering the order you have to input command line arguments in can get annoying, so the coreLN cli lets you add the -k flag to just explicitly label your arguments as key=value pairs, 

```
l1-cli fundchannel -k id=02348345cbe1b14d5660c47a3a17005f882fb96be38497fc4c5f2259af6e4e1b78 amount=10000000sat feerate=250
```

If you did it right, you should see a return with the completed tx information. Let's mine a block to confirm the TX (remember, we're on regtest so have to do block production ourselves) then run `l1-cli helpme` again. 
```
bt-cli generatetoaddress 1 $(bt-cli getnewaddress) && l1-cli helpme
```
You should see we've "Working" on step 3 by opening a channel. That'll update to COMPLETE once the channel's a couple blocks deep, but don't do that yet there's a little more to explain!

### An Aside on The Funding Transaction

Let's take a sec to parse what the funding transaction looks like. Yours will be different, but should look similar to this:
```
{
   "tx": "020000000001011ab18c3018b34fa83fea330d1fea046aaba05e48907ff0f5494606cc03e632370300000000fdffffff0280969800000000002200209793b535a2ed541eda684496ef0ed0d1059aaaf0fd5dd4bbf2f59f52721523e5e632023b00000000160014f89ad37ae2fada6473228e6039f6b0e5f330affe02473044022072cfac46806ba0d2b0eb0967e178d670bd185557cd3f92ef8e3f6c445b79c91002205f3d36186fc04394708c1fe8a9f1a97d064a2d67e3f57a1eea068eac112bacf0012102984ff808535936ff8f2de909e6d6f5ad6e79eccc98e970c446ac929044e8cf7a67000000",
   "txid": "0a5d6cb1f597dc846051765e085770854cae911edec63094bce673aa4b1f0d28",
   "channel_id": "280d1f4baa73e6bc9430c6de1e91ae4c857057085e76516084dc97f5b16c5d0a",
   "outnum": 0
}
```

You can parse this into something more human readable with the bitcoin-cli by running,
```
bt-cli decoderawtransaction replace_me_with_the_raw_tx

## replace the arg above with your outputted tx string starting with 020000000001...
```

As we can see, the funding transaction takes a single input (the UTXO we sent from the bt-cli earlier), and has 2 outputs to 2 different address types. The second output is l1's change back to itself, a new Pay2WitnessPubKeyHash address. The first output, for 10million sats, locks to a Pay2WitnessScriptHash address. We know it's a lightning channel, but as of right now no one else does for sure. We're eventually going to gossip that it's a lightning channel to everyone else, but if someone were only looking at layer 1 bitcoin they wouldn't know that we're using that P2WSH for lightning stuff.

### Another Aside on Channels

Let's check out what our channel looks like to our node (reminder, this is the only channel we've opened) by running `l1-cli listchannels`

Why is there nothing here, we mined a block confirming the TX which opened our channel? For similar reasons to why our lightning node wouldn't let us use the bitcoin we'd sent it until it was 6 confirmations deep, lightning channels (even public ones like we're making) aren't gossipped and regularly usable for 6 confirmations. 

(This changed recently with '0-conf Channels' aka a generally bad idea that made its way into the lightning spec because lightning service providers want better UX at the cost of good engineering.)

Let's mine another 6 blocks and run the command again
```
bt-cli generatetoaddress 6 $(bt-cli getnewaddress) && l1-cli listchannels
## if you run l1-cli helpme now Stage 3 should say COMPLETE
```

A question you're probably asking right now, why are there 2 channels showing up? If we take a closer look, we'll notice that our 2 way channel is actually represented as 2 separate 1 way channel data structures, from l1->l2 and from l2->l1. This lets the 2 parties set different feerates, different minimums, and other configurations depending on which way the funds are flowing.

### Exercise D

    1. Open another one-way channel from l2 to l3. If you did it correctly you should see l2 has 2 channels if you run l2-cli helpme, while l3-cli should only show 1 channel. Don't forget to mine 6 blocks to confirm the channel!


### An Aside On Gossip, and the Differences between Peers and Nodes

Let's take a second to talk about gossip. The Lightning Network uses a gossip protocol to relay information around, where peers learn new things and pass that information on to other peers. We can see that our nodes have started gossipping information to each other already by comparing the outputs of the following commands:
```
l1-cli getinfo
## This should return num_peers=1, we've only connected l1 to l2
## then run
l1-cli listnodes
```
If l1 only connected to l2, how does it know about l3? More interestingly, how does it also know about the channel between l2 and l3? Run `l1-cli listchannels` to confirm.

This is the gossip protocol at work: l2 told l1 about the channel it opened with l3. l1 can now use this node information to connect to l3, and can use the channel information to construct routes for payments. We're ready to create and pay our first invoice!

## Stages 4 & 5 : Making and Receiving Payments

As our lightning network is set up right now: 
    1. l1 has outbound capacity to l2, but has no inbound capacity
    1. l2 has outbound capacity to l3, and has inbound capacity from l1
    3. l3 has no outbound capacity, but has inbound capacity from l2

So l1 cannot receive payments, l3 cannot send payments, and l2 can only send to l3 and only receive from l1. If we tried to send a payment from l3 to l1, we wouldn't be able to. Notice that the following command lets us create an invoice, but has an attached warning that we don't have incoming capacity to actually receive if someone tried to pay it.
```
l1-cli invoice 600000sat 'inv-0' 'trial receive'
```

Well then, let's try making a payment from l1 to l3, because that's how the channel funds are set up.

```
l3-cli invoice 600000sat 'inv-0' 'trial receive'
```

Notice that there's no warning here. Our l3 node has sufficient incoming capacity. As the originator of the invoice, it's not the one constructing the route, it just needs to know that the last hop is possible.

So l3 wants to receive a payment from l1: we've created the invoice, now we need to pass it to l1. If we were using bolt12 offers l1 could have asked for the invoice directly from l3, but the more common bolt11 invoice needs to get passed another way. We'll just copy it over when we try to pay it with l1.

```
l1-cli pay replace_me_with_invoice
## replace the argument with the bolt11 invoice you generated, it starts with lnbc...
```

And there we go! We just made a lightning payment from l1 to l3, bouncing it off l2! (you can see that l2 took a small fee for relaying the payment by comparing the amount_msat, which is how much the invoice was for, to the amount_sent_msat, which is what we paid (invoice amount + fees)).

### Exercise E

We've completed STAGE 5 for l3, receiving a payment, and STAGE 4 for l1, making a payment. Make a payment back from l3 to l1 to complete those 2 incomplete stages respectively. Use helpme if you need a hand :)

## Stage 6: Adding Bling and Visualizing Your Channels with "Summary"
The final step of the helpme plugin's Node Setup Walkthrough is "adding bling". Follow the instructions in `l1-cli helpme bling` to set your alias and color to something fun!

Now as great as giant command line json returns are, it's also nice to be able to see a picture of your node. We're going to plugin another process called "summary" to our l2, which prints out a nice in terminal summary of the current state of our node and its channels.
```
l2-cli plugin start $PWD/plugins/summary/summary.py && 
l2-cli summary
```

CoreLN's plugin architecture makes it incredibly easy for you to add, remove, and change functionality to tailor your node to meet your needs (or just make fun tools!).

### Exercise F
```
Try to balance the inbound/outbound liquidity in each of the channels by creating and paying invoices between the nodes until all nodes have ~50% inbound/outbound on the summary plugin terminal printout.
```

## Collaborative Channel Opens with Liquidity Ads

As you can probably tell after that exercise, rebalancing liquidity can be a total pain! For the first years of the lightning network, new nodes consistently ran into the inbound liquidity problem: you can't receive payments until you have inbound liquidity from another node, but why would someone want to open a channel to a new and poorly connected node?

Liquidity ads are an in-spec solution to this problem, and allow you to advertise your willingness to collaboratively open a channel to another party. And instead of opening 2 channels, one with l2's funds and one with l1's funds, the 2 nodes will open a single channel with balanced inbound/outbound capacity between the nodes. 

Let's use some of l2's on-chain funds to make a liquidity ad using the funder plugin (it ships by default with coreln so will already be running on our nodes!):
```
l2-cli funderupdate -k leases_only=true lease_fee_base_msat=10sat lease_fee_basis=50
```

And if we run the listnodes command from l1, we'll see that l2 is now advertising its willingness to open collaborative channels! (might need to wait a second for l2 to gossip about its new liquidity ad!)
```
l1-cli listnodes

## and in the return json you'll see something that looks a little like this:
## ...
"option_will_fund": {
            "lease_fee_base_msat": "100000msat",
            "lease_fee_basis": 50,
            "funding_weight": 666,
            "channel_fee_max_base_msat": "5000000msat",
            "channel_fee_max_proportional_thousandths": 100,
            "compact_lease": "029a00320064000000644c4b40"
         }
```

Alright! l2 is gossipping that it's willing to open collaborative channels and has the funds to do it, let's open a channel with it! The only arguments we'll have to add different than the one-way open are a request_amount, how much we'd like to have as inbound from l2, and the compact_lease, which are the liquidity ad terms for fees we're negotiating the collaborative open around:

```
l1-cli fundchannel -k id=replace_me_with_l2_nodeid amount=100000sat request_amt=100000sat compact_lease=replace_me_with_compact_lease
```

If we run `l1-cli summary` again, we'll see that this new node we opened is balanced between both parties!

### Exercise G
```
Try opening a collaborative channel between l3 and l1 using a liquidity ad from l3. You can also try doing an open from l3 to l2 using the same l2 compact_lease as before, the liquidity ad works as long as the node has funds to open more channels!!
```
